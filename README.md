# Simple authentication in Nuxt 3

I used [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) as the fake API endpoint to authentication.

## Also in this project I used:

 - Tailwind CSS
 - Pinia
 - VeeValidate
 - EsLint

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# yarn
yarn dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:
